# code-refactor: Homework assignment 1

## Description

This is homework assignment 1 for unit 1.

We were given html and css for a webpage and were tasked to refactor it.

The goal of the refactor is to use semantic HTML tags instead of generic `div` tags.

We also were tasked to improve accessibility and clean the html and css text.
